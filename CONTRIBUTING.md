## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React Native

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

### File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/            # Screen components
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/              # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ services/           # API and external services
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/          # App constants
â””â”€â”€ types/              # TypeScript types (if using TS)
```

### Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (`TaskCard.js`)
- Files: camelCase (`notificationService.js`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
- Functions: camelCase (`calculateHealthScore`)

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should do something when condition is met', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle error case appropriately', () => {
    // Error case test
  });
});
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Document complex algorithms
- Explain business logic
- Update README for new features

### JSDoc Example

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the health score based on completed tasks
 * @param {Array} completedTasks - Array of completed task IDs
 * @returns {number} Health score from 0 to 100
 */
function calculateHealthScore(completedTasks) {
  // Implementation
}
```
